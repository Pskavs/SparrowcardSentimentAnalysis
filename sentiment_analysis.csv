"The application process is easy and the app is better than other predatory cards and I'm a huge fan of payments applying directly to the card so you can use what you pay right away.

The catch of the card is they promote it heavily as a card that grows with you .

"Never heard of this card before. Credit karma said I had outstanding approval odds. I was 4 months out of bankruptcy I applied for the card through credit karma, was approved right away. The customer service, the emails checking on customer satisfaction is outstanding. I really see no flaws with this card for rebuilding credit, are those starting fresh. This is just a personal thing but, I wish the initial available credit would have been more. But then again, you have to start somewhere. Starting with this card you would not be dissatisfied. Thank you credit karma and Sparrow. I appreciate you as well. Oh, huge point.. The phone app with all your information at your fingertips is the best part.",0.9979082345962524,0.002091825008392334

Applied and was approved for card with $300 CL. Physical card never came so I called to inquire why. Informed some Magical department sent me an email (I never received said email) to which I didn’t respond so they blocked the mailing of the physical card. To correct this the rep would need to put in a ticket to send to the magical email department to then resend the email!? Whaaaat? Keep in mind at this point I have had the card a couple months and made multiple payment. I paid off the remaining balance owed and closed the account. No thanks!,0.9982390403747559,0.0017609591595828533

"Initially I liked this card because you can pay it off throught the month and keep using it, for 5 months now I usually max my little 300 limit out 2 or 3 times .....now they blocked my card and wat bank statements from me 5 months later mind you to prove I'm paying them with my own account.....so I'm being penalized for paying my bills on time and not carrying a balance and thus making you guys interest? Yeah, no thanks. I refused to send bank account infor to some random overseas customer service for a measly 300 credit card. Cancelled",0.9982221722602844,0.00177779293153435

"The application and approval process was very easy. However, I didn't realize that support is app only. You cannot login to your account online. Also there is no auto pay and I added my bank account thinking it would be autopaid - it was not. I was immediately charged a late fee the next day even though I logged into the app to initiate a payment. Customer service was great and they explained that they did not support auto pay of bill every month. I wish I knew this up front though. So note that you will have to manually keep track of the billing and pay 5 days in advance because payments take 3-5 business days to process. Other than that, this card is great and I like the customer service.",0.9988355040550232,0.0011645134072750807

It took almost 7 weeks to receive my card in the mail. When I did i activated it immediately. Said activation was successful then I was declined. Called the company they said they turned the card off because it took over 60 days to activate. Makes no sense and clearly taking 7 weeks to send it to me was on them. Asked if I could speak to a supervisor. The man named egl said he had no supervisor he’s the boss. I know this is not true and I was lied to. Very shady will never deal with them again and I hope this does not affect my credit,0.9983774423599243,0.0016225622966885567

I was approved for the card with no issues. But upon approval I only got a $300 limit. Even though the first year annual fee is only $59 not worth having a fee of 33% of the limit thereafter. Had I known it was only going to be $300 limit I would have never applied. Closed the account before I ever got the card.,0.9987471103668213,0.0012528437655419111
